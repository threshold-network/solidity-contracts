== Introduction

The Vending Machine contracts implement a special update protocol to enable
legacy token holders (NU/KEEP) to wrap their tokens and obtain T tokens 
according to a fixed, pre-defined ratio. The contracts are completely autonomous
and will work indefinitely, enabling NU and KEEP token holders to join the 
T network without needing to buy or sell any assets. Logistically, anyone
holding NU or KEEP can wrap those assets in order to upgrade to T. They can also 
unwrap T in order to downgrade back to the underlying asset. 

There is a separate instance of this contract deployed for KEEP holders and a 
separate instance of this contract deployed for NU holders.

== Public API

=== Wrapping and unwrapping

=== `wrap(uint256 amount) external` 

Wraps up to the the given `amount` of a legacy token (KEEP/NU) and releases T
tokens proportionally to the amount being wrapped, according to the wrap ratio. 
The token holder needs to have at least the given amount of the wrapped token 
(KEEP/NU) previously approved to the Vending Machine before calling this 
function. Note that, since the Vending Machine guarantees exact conversion, 
there may be a small unspent remainder on the token holder balance.

Emits a `Wrapped(address indexed recipient, uint256 wrappedTokenAmount,
uint256 tTokenAmount)' event.

=== `unwrap(uint256 amount) external`

Unwraps up to the given `amount` of T back to the Vending Machine's legacy token
(KEEP/NU), according to the wrap ratio. It can only be called by a token holder
who previously wrapped their tokens in this vending machine contract. The token 
holder can't unwrap more tokens than they originally wrapped. The token holder
needs to have at least the given amount of T tokens approved to transfer to the
Vending Machine before calling this function. Note that, since the Vending
Machine guarantees exact conversion, there may be a small unspent remainder on
the token holder balance.

Emits an `Unwrapped(address indexed recipient, uint256 tTokenAmount,
uint256 wrappedTokenAmount)` event.

=== Conversion rate utilities

==== `conversionToT(uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256 tAmount, uint256 wrappedRemainder)`

Returns the T token amount that's obtained from `amount` wrapped tokens 
(KEEP/NU), and the `wrappedRemainder` that can't be upgraded.

==== `conversionFromT(uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256 wrappedAmount, uint256 tRemainder)`

Returns the amount of wrapped tokens (KEEP/NU) that's obtained from unwrapping 
`amount` T tokens, and the `tRemainder` that can't be downgraded.

=== Vending Machine parameters

TODO

== Security considerations

=== Token total supplies

The logic of the vending machine contracts assumes that the total supply of the
underlying legacy tokens is fixed

=== Contract ownership

The vending machine contracts are not ownable.

=== Upgradeability

The vending machine contracts are not upgradeable.
